## R Markdown

# myrepo
reteaching myself rstudio basics for funzies

## 1: set up, refamiliarizing, markdown, and github basics
### file notes: 'day one basics.Rmd' feb 11, '22

```{r}
library(rmarkdown)
```

Opened RMarkdown file

file -> New File -> R Markdown

> this is so silly I should be able to understand something this basic but I'm just trying to figure out how to make honest to god plain text in a Markdown file that shows up when I run it and I don't know what I am doing wrong. 

Plain type returns plain type check

```{r}
# type inside of code chunks does not appear in final rendering of document. A hashtag precedes comments or it will run as code
```

unexpected symbol error at beginning of plain type line. one hashtag necessary to indicate comment?

hashtag test seems to confirm this. Readings would have me to believe that hashtags signify a heading so next test is multiple hashtags.

no visible difference in console panel, however no error message for multiple hashtags either, returned to lines adding a single hashtag to plain text comments for consistency and spaces for clarity. 

Rmd saved under name 'day one basics.Rmd' in file folder R -> Learning

what is a markup language? similar to html like editing source in tumblr blog source code? Markdown is used for readability "no tags necessary" so interesting 

> pause to mess with GitHub. also fuck github and programmers for not understanding that basics mean, 'explain what a file even is' for me

started new repository on Github with a README.md file

uploaded new 'one day basics.Rmd' file. Text is still blue with hashtag showing at the beginning of each line so am not sure this is how markdown works? 

added library(rmarkdown) to file and will retest

can edit markdown files directly on Github interface but trying to update an existing file 'push' or 'commit' a new file to a git repository.

cfss uchicago class site has a setup tab to help make sure set up is complete. will read and return hopefully more confident.

```{r}
install.packages(c("dplyr","tidyverse","rmarkdown","knitr","gapminder","tidytext","devtools","usethis", "broom", "shiny", "readr", "RColorBrewer", "rsconnect"))
```

installed packages from course site, code used was install.packages("package_name") additional c() used for multiple packages at once

> ohmygod i found my shinyapp final project for the cfss class! added libraries for the app ('shiny', 'readr', 'RColorBrewer', 'rsconnect') and the URL https://eggst.shinyapps.io/Exoplanets/ but cannot get distracted by late game projects i can't work!

following the directions to setup R, RStudio, Github, and starting a git repository.

tested committing to github twice once setup complete. using right-top pane, selecting files to commit.

part 2 is to 'pull'/'push' the commits so they actually show up online.

blue arrow is 'pull' -> bringing files from online in git to RStudio?

green arrow is 'push' -> pushing my files to publish online?!

> authorizing and checking site: SUCCESS!!!!!!!

gonna try and make a new document in myrepo for this so i have separate files of notes? Unsure of this ability so will put multiple days under new headings. must remove my hashtags lmao. 

I think plain text will be fine, and no code ran that wasn't in a line by itself (library('name')) ran but not (install.packages('package')) and no extra comment on the url but works when an html preview was made? 

these notes don't look great in a long spiel like that but going further more code should break it up. 

*notes on fa18_hw01 shows i don't need to commit the README.html since it can't be seen in github anyway.*
